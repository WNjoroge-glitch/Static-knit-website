                <p><br><span><strong>Hello There,</strong></span></br>My name is Dee. I crotchet and knit during my free time(And if we're being honest, even when i should be doing other things). I love a good challenge and learning to do this on the internet was definitely that.As an overachiever, i know how easy it is to get distracted by the world and not focus on the little things that bring you joy.May this blog remind you to take sometime for yourself to do a fun thing.
